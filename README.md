<h1>CUB3D</h1>

<p><strong>This is a 3D game development project that challenges you to build a game engine from scratch using the raycasting technique.
The goal of the project is to create a 3D game engine that can render a 3D world on a 2D screen. To achieve this, you will need to read a map file that specifies the layout of the game world, including the location of walls, sprites, and other game objects. The engine will then use raycasting to render the 3D world on the screen, creating the illusion of depth and perspective.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In addition to the rendering engine, you will also need to implement game mechanics such as collision detection, player movement, and the ability to interact with objects in the game world. This will challenge you to think creatively and solve complex problems, such as efficiently rendering a 3D world on a 2D screen </strong></p>

<p><strong>By completing the Cub3d project, you will gain valuable experience in computer graphics and game development, including concepts such as vector math, matrix transformations, and raycasting. This project is a great introduction to the world of game development and can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced projects in the field.</strong></p>
